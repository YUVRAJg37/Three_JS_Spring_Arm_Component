# Introduction
The Spring Arm Component is a tool designed for 3D applications built using the Three.js library. It enhances camera control in the 3D scene, offering smooth, interactive, and collision-aware camera movement. 

## Features

### Spring Arm Component
- Seamless integration of a spring arm, providing precise control over the camera's position relative to a target object. Maintain a constant distance and angle from the target, creating smooth and dynamic camera movement.

### Collision-Aware Camera Control
- Prevents camera collision with objects in the 3D scene through bounding volume checks. Ensures that the camera never gets too close to or intersects with objects, avoiding visual artifacts.

### Raycasting for Obstruction Detection
- Utilizes raycasting to detect obstructions and obstacles between the camera's current position and the desired location. This ensures that the camera adapts intelligently to the scene, avoiding unwanted intersections and delivering realistic camera behavior.

### Smooth Camera Adjustments
- Achieve gradual and fluid camera adjustments when no collisions are detected. The system smoothly transitions the camera to the desired state, simulating the behavior of a spring arm.
